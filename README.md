#Programming Test: Mars Rover

Requirement:

Develop a application that moves a rover around on a grid.

##Rules:

1.The rover receives a character array of commands.
2.Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (F,B).
3.Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (L,R).
4.Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)

Optional (Time permitting)

Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.
