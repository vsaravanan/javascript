            <p><strong>Programming Test: Mars Rover</strong></p>
            <h2>Requirement:</h2>
            <p>Develop a application that moves a rover around on a grid.</p>
            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.</li>
                <li>The rover receives a character array of commands.</li>
                <li>Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (F,B).</li>
                <li>Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (L,R).</li>
                <li>Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Optional (Time permitting)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.</li>
            </ul>
